# BSE_scheduling
 
This Git repository contains a lot of files which are mostly scratch files. The current working files of note here are:
- Scheduling2 - this function is seperated into an 'info' and a 'swap' function.
     - The info function accepts 2 data points in order to locate the 3rd data point in the 'Sched_master.xlsx' spreadsheet
     - the swap function accepts full sheet/date data and allows you to swap an engineer in and out of the spreadsheet.
